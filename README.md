- Hey, Welcome to Easy as Py Sports 

- I am a 27 year old Cybersecurity Analyst looking to break into the Sports Data Science Space.
  
- I will be returning to school next year(2025) pursuing a masters in Data Science through the University of Pittsburgh.
  
- I am using this as a space to share the tools and findings I create with the world why allowing
  for someone to replicate the processeses used for their own sports research. Join me on my journey to
  create clear and concise findings/trends in an effort to effectively predict performance relative to DFS, Fantasy Sports
  and Sports Betting.
  
- I would love to collaborate with anyone else looking to predict trends in the NFL and NBA spaces
  (I will be looking to include Baseball, but I gotta start somewhere)
